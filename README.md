# Lan Server Properties
For Minecraft 1.12.2, May work with lower versions(__No guarantee__). \

This mod is a client-only mod, do not install it on a dedicated server!

When this mod is installed, it will add a few new things to the "Open to LAN" Gui, which then allows the user to start the LAN game on a specific port, and also provides an option to disable the "online mode". Disabling the "online mode" allows unauthenticated players to join the game.

## For developers
```
# Setup development workspace
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
# Build
./gradlew build
# Develop in eclipse, run the following then import the repo as an eclipse project (not a gradle project)
./gradlew eclipse
```
