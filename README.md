# LAN Server Properties
For Minecraft 1.12â€“1.16, and Forge.

When this mod is installed, it enhances the vanilla Minecraft "Open to LAN" screen, which now also:
* Allows for a port customization
* Allows a user to disable the online mode, so that also unauthenticated players can join the LAN server.

## For developers
To modify and debug the code, first import the repo as a Gradle project in Eclipse IDE, and then run the ForgeGradle task `genEclipseRuns`.
