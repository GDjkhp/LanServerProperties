# Lan Server Properties
For Minecraft 1.14.4, Forge version >= 28 \
Modifying the mods.toml inside the jar may allow this mod to work in pre 1.14.4 versions (__No guarantee__)

When this mod is installed, it will add a few new things to the "Open to LAN" Gui, which then allows the user to start the LAN game on a specific port, and also provides an option to disable the "online mode". Disabling the "online mode" allows unauthenticated players to join the game.
