# Lan Server Properties
For Minecraft 1.14.4, Forge version >= 28 \
Modifying the mods.toml inside the jar may allow this mod to work in 1.13 to 1.14.2 (__No guarantee__)

When this mod is installed, it will add a few new things to the "Open to LAN" Gui, which then allows the user to start the LAN game on a specific port, and also provides an option to disable the "online mode". Disabling the "online mode" allows unauthenticated players to join the game.

## For developers
To modify and debug the code, first import the repo as a gradle project in Eclipse IDE, then run the ForgeGradle task `genEclipseRuns`.
